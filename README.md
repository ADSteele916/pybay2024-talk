# Architecting Native Extension Modules for Python

This repository contains the Beamer code for my "Architecting Native Extension Modules for Python" talk at [PyBay 2024](https://pybay.org/).

## Viewing the Slides

A PDF with the slides can be found [on the Releases page](https://github.com/ADSteele916/pybay2024-talk/releases).

## Compiling the Slides

If, for whatever reason, you want to compile the slides, you'll need a $\LaTeX$ installation that supports the XeTeX typesetting engine. I use MiKTeX on Windows.
For the formatting to work, you'll need Pygments. Make sure that you have a modern system Python installation and run
```
pip install pygments
```
I haven't tested this with a virtual environment; I don't particularly care about a small bit of clutter in my global packages to make command-line utilities easily available.
